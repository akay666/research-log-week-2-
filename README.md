# research-log-week-2-
I did a mini-project on this week. my mini-project is about ski bob Lego. There are 16 pieces Legos to combine a ski bob. I think making and explaining a stuff of Lego is interesting. First at all, I pick a model of Lego. Next, the Lego was speareted. Finally, remake the Lego. 
I finish my mini-project on Wednesday cause of disscusion on Thursday. I am trying to use a simple way to explain the model processing. Hence, each classmates can understand my composition and remake my model. The classmates give me a good responds.   
In the min-project, there are many photos. I prefer to use the application of Word because I am good at using the Word. 
I learn how to do technical writing in a simple way. Addition, in the group chat, I learn how to be my work prefect. Everybody has their own good details and composition in their own word. I can learn some good values from their jobs.
